Space Pirates
=============

Note that this is a very early hack / concept.

Idea
----

* Two planets, two teams (you join randomly, or depending on balance)
* Acceleration / maneuvering costs fuel
* Orbiting around enemy planet adds resources to your ship until it's full
* Orbiting around your own planet:
   - restores fuel level
   - empties carco bay, adds resources to your planet
* Crashing into opponent's (or own team's) spaceship: destroys both ships, you both get to restart
* Goal: Getting as much resources to your planet as possible
* Multiplayer: will be played by as many as possible via node.js/socket.io sync
